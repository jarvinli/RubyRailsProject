psuedo code for index html and all the mini project bull....
//1 is for player 1 and 2 is for player 2.
//0 is set at the start as a way to signify the game has not started
varr turn = 0; 
//creates 6 rows
varr row = new Array(6);
// creates 7 columns
row[0] = new Array(7); 
row[1] = new Array(7);
row[2] = new Array(7);
row[3] = new Array(7);
row[4] = new Array(7);
row[5] = new Array(7);
//basically a 2D array row is the name of the array ROW[row][col]

Start with page
display player 1 and player 2 and scores underneath and or whoes turn it is.
